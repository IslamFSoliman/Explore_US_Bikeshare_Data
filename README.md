# US Bike Share Analysis
### Udacity Data Analysis Professional Nanodegree January 2021 - March 2021
#### Project 1: US Bike Share Analysis using Python

## Project Overview
In this project, I will make use of Python to explore data related to bikeshare systems for three major bikeshare systems in the United States. I will perform data wrangling to unify the format of data from the three systems and write code to compute descriptive statistics. I will also make use of a package that is not part of the standard Python library to help me visualize the data.

## Project Objective
The purpose of this task is to become familliar with the data analysis process. This process will be done using a Jupyter Notebook.

## Code Quality
* All code cells can be run without error.
* Appropriate data types (e.g. strings, floats) and data structures (e.g. lists, dictionaries) are chosen to carry out the required analysis tasks.
* Loops and conditional statements are used to process the data correctly.
* Packages are used to carry out advanced tasks such as reading and writing files and creating visualizations.
* Functions are used to reduce repetitive code.
* Use of good coding practices: Docstrings, comments, and variable names enable readability of the code.
## Responses to Analysis Questions
1. At least two questions are posed regarding bike-share system use that can be answered with data.
2. Code is written that can read in the original data and print out the first element of each file.
3. Each of the original data files is converted into new data files that allow for information to be accessed consistently between cities.
4. Descriptive statistics are correctly computed and used to answer the questions posed about the data.
5. Visualizations are created that show the distribution of trip durations for both subscribers and customers. Qualities of these distributions are described in the report.
6. The dataset is explored in one additional way starting from a posed question. The exploration includes at least two variables, computed statistics, and at least one visualization. One field where data analysis techniques can be applied is described, including a specific potential application.
First project in Data Analysis Professinal Nano-Degree program from Udacity.com

### The program request for three inputs (city, month, and day) from the user and takes 3 .csv files to explore it's data to return the following:

1. Most popular month, day, and hour the bikes were used.
2. Most popular starting statation and ending station.
3. Most frequent combination of start station and end station.
4. Total travel time of all trips.
5. Average travel time.
6. The counts of user types.
7. User gender count.
8. Getting the earliest, most recent, and most common year of birth.
9. Showing some raw data if user choose to.
